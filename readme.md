## What I learned

I learned a lot about CSS features like media-queries - I knew they existed, but it's a lot more clear now. Also now I know to think about your layout as a whole thing, not style single components because it will start getting messy(e. g. do one class to make you'r block elements go flex). Through this course I started using SCSS so my final solution is in SCSS. I know that's the beggining of my journey to full understanding of mobile-first approach, but by the time it will get easier to do! I just need to practice it! ðŸ’»ðŸ“š
